            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Tokyo</h1>
            <p style="padding: 20px;">Tokyo (/ˈtoʊkiˌoʊ/; Japanese: 東京, Tōkyō [toːkʲoː] (About this soundlisten)), officially Tokyo Metropolis (東京都, Tōkyō-to), is the capital of Japan and the most populous of the country's 47 prefectures. Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, the prefecture forms part of the Kantō region on the central Pacific coast of Japan's main island, Honshu. Tokyo is the political, economic, and cultural center of Japan, and houses the seat of the Emperor and the national government. The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes several neighboring prefectures, is the largest urban economy and the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 38.1 million residents as of 2017.

                Originally a small fishing village named Edo, the city became a prominent political center under shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu, who made Edo Castle his military headquarters in 1603. By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the largest cities in the world, with a population of more than one million. Following the end of the shogunate in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to the city, which was renamed Tokyo (literally "eastern capital"). Tokyo was devastated by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, and again by Allied bombing raids during World War II. In the 1950s, the city began a period of rapid reconstruction and expansion, going on to lead the country's post-war economic recovery. Since 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's 23 special wards (formerly Tokyo City), various bed towns in the western area, and two outlying island chains.
                
                Tokyo is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Part of an industrial region that includes the neighboring cities of Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba, the city is Japan's leading center of business, manufacturing, and finance. As of 2019, Tokyo hosted 36 of the Fortune Global 500 companies.[7] In 2020, it ranked third on the Global Financial Centres Index, behind only New York City and London.[8]
                
                The city has hosted multiple international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and three G7 Summits (1979, 1986, and 1993); it will also host the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. Tokyo is an international center of research and development and is represented by several major universities, notably the University of Tokyo. The city is the primary hub for Japan's Shinkansen bullet train system, and is connected by an extensive network of rail and subways. Notable districts of Tokyo include Chiyoda (the site of the Imperial Palace and National Diet Building), Shinjuku (the city's administrative center), and Shibuya (a commercial and business hub).</p>
